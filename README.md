# CollabMaze
Bachelor Thesis "Tangible User Interface for Supporting Goal Interdependence"

I have built and implemented different levels of mazes and added some gamification stuffs like 
1. the player can choose different control characters
2. i have added some coins and keys for players to collect on the ways towards the exit of the maze
3. some monsters have been placed on the ways to obstruct the players

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to compare whether children are more effective at collaborative learning using physical or virtual interactions. 
For the physical user interface i made two tangible joysticks using the microcontroller Arduino to control the character movement. 
For virtual user interface i simply use the tourch screen from IPad.
